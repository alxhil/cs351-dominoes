-- Things that I didn't get around to adding
 - Enemy player
 
 
-- Bugs
 - Sometimes the dominos tiles switch around if you perform a backwards placement
 - If you click on a dominos tile that is placed on the board then the game will start erroring
 - If you click on the text on the boneyard then nothing will happen, but you can click anywhere on the purple area
 
-- Things I wanted to get to
 - I wanted to change my entire method of clicking and possibly making every domino a panel but
 - I went the complicated route of using ArrayLists, it was a learning experience for sure.
